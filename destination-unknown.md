Our trip is being decided for us. 

Next stop was Argentina (Buenos Aires) but we can't go. Argentina will not grant visas for US citizens. (original plan was to fly on Mar 21).

This morning I saw that Disneyland was closing and just now read that ALL Disney parks are closing starting Monday. We just completed 8 days over two weeks at Disney World, so we're done anyway. 

So what's next? Figuring out plan B, C, D, E, and F.

We have one more week in Orlando, so we're ok on housing. We have a lot of flexibility on where to go since I still have the next 5 months off. Our plans for the week were to take it easy, go to nature preserves, and Kennedy Space Center (if still open). But now it'll be more focused on planning, knowing the situation will keep changing. And going to nature preserves.

But where can we go given so many cities are shutting down? A very big unknown.

Ideas

* Rent (or buy then sell if more cost effective) an RV and travel in the US to National Parks, particularly on the eastern half of the US since that's harder for us to get to normally (we live in the Pacific Northwest).
  * I think we could handle 1-3 weeks in an RV but not the entire time, and after doing a bit of research they're kind of expensive to rent, and even more expensive to buy.
* Fly to Australia or another country that does not have travel restrictions, do the trip in reverse order if possible.
* Go back home and pause the trip? Probably not. School has been cancelled for the next 1.5 months (to April 24) anyway.
* Something else?
