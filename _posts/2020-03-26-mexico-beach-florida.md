We went to the beach today, right on the Gulf of Mexico. This is a shocking thing to say in the time of coronavirus. [Mexico Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_Beach%2C_Florida) also happens to be the only beach open in Florida. There were few people there, we easily had 30 feet on either side of us away from others. So we went. I'm told pre-hurricane it gets PACKED with people, but many businesses were destroyed and the housing is still being worked on, so there aren't many people these days.

The water is so warm. The Atlantic is more blue, this water is more brown and silty. Of course we put up our best defense against being knocked down by waves. Big Kid kept finding little sea shells churned up in the water and dotting the beach. I just enjoyed myself and being there in the moment which in the past has been more rare that should be. My mind only thinking here and there about plans for the rest of the trip (how quickly to get back vs we need to do something with the kids for the summer too wherever we are) but mostly just enjoying standing in the water and waves crashing against my legs.

Little Kid made it to his self-defined level 1,000,000 in standing in the waves, then declared "I can do whatever I want" according to his leveling practices. So he played in the sand. Big Kid helped. Big Kid even sat in front of Little Kid's sand creation with his legs out to shield it from the ocean waves. It didn't work so well (it's hard to control the ocean, after all), but shows they do get along sometimes.

Pelicans fly overhead, the ones in the distance dive-bomb the ocean with a huge spray as they slice into the water. Seagulls, perhaps more refined in color than where we live, are all around. And overhead two native fighter jets fly by, going back to their natural habitat of the huge air force base nearby. 

Back at the boat had lemon sorbet for treat time on the top deck of the boat. Make-your-own burrito bowls for dinner.
