We're exhausted! So glad that tomorrow is a lazy day.

We made it into the park a minute after rope drop (when the park opens). Amazing.

Big Kid LOVED the Avatar Flight of Passage. We all did (except Little Kid, who we didn't take on it). It really gave a strong impression of flying. Amazing. Big Kid got to go on Expedition Everest 3 times, Dinosaur 2 times, Na'vi River ride 2 times, as well as some other rides.

We stayed through the evening and seeing the River of Light show. Instead of following the hoards to the park exit, we kept going to see the park at night and walked through Africa. So beautiful, so few people, and in some areas we had the entire place to ourselves, you'd never know anyone else was there.

The final cherry-on-top: walking over to Avatar land to see what it looked like. Neon blacklight colors everywhere, including the walkways, alien plants, and the whites of our shirts. What a way to end the evening.

The kids were perfectly behaved and playing games on the Kindle together while waiting for the light show for 45 minutes. On the walk through the park at night, they were running and dancing in the empty lands. But the car ride home, which is only 10-15 minutes in all, very quickly devolved to bickering and tears. It's the same story every night after the parks.
