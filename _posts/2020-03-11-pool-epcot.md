Big Kid was so excited to go swimming in the pool that they wanted to leave Epcot in the afternoon.

I ferried Little Kid in the pool from pool ladder to ladder to stairs (the pool is vaguely Mickey-shaped). He laid down on my outstretched arms like he was swimming but held on to me and kicked. Occasionally Big Kid became a lamprey and held on my back too, except this was a lamprey that could also kick to propel us forward. Little Kid tells me where to go, and sometimes lets me choose which ladder or stairs to go to.

Earlier in the day at Epcot:

Slept in, got to the parks around 10:30am. We're wearing down.

Managed to get fast passes for the Frozen ride, a minor miracle since it was usually sold out or had very long wait times. Parent took a video of the entire ride to show me since it was unlikely that I'd have time to wait to go on it (which turned out to be true!).

Waited over an hour for Test Track. Big Kid was so bored in line but patient and well-behaved. The ride was surprisingly better than expected. Worth the wait? Not so sure. 

I sat next to a person who worked at the Disney World (Hollywood Studios) helping with something related to beverage deliveries or services. She loves her job and on her off time she still loves going to Disney World to go on the rides. This is exactly the type of person you want to hire at your company.

On Mission: Space (simulates rocketing to Mars), the slow line was going fast and the fast line slow. So unfair because we had a fast pass to get on quick. We bailed after waiting 30 min with little progress. And then I realized we had been in the wrong line — the 90 min standby line — the whole time. Oops.

We took turns taking Big Kid on rides while the other sat with Little Kid. I spent an hour inside the nighttime inside-as-outside, air conditioned Mexican pavilion letting Little Kid have down time playing on the Kindle while I read. Eventually we left and found a playground which he loved. 

Big Kid and I went on Soarin', meanwhile Parent coaxed Little Kid into going onto the Land boat ride. He loved it so much he wanted to go on it again immediately. I thought it was a boat ride through a greenhouse, and it was, but much more, including classic dark ride scenery. Much better than expected.
