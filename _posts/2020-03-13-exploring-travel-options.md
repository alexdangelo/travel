**Good news**: can get a full credit for cancelling the Orlando -> Argentina flight

**Bad news**: no plans to fly to Brazil to use the credit

\[_Update 3/18: I was able to get a partial refund of about 22% of what I originally paid. Better than nothing_\]

Stopped by an RV dealer to do research. Big Kid really wants us to rent an RV and keeps making arguments about why we should do it. We keep giving the same response "it's a possibility but we just don't know if it makes sense or where we might do it".

Considering flying to New Zealand and doing the original trip in reverse. It's cheap to fly -- $630 per person from Orlando to Auckland via SFO. Downside: 19 hours of flying: 6 to SFO, 13 to Auckland. I don't know that I want to put the kids through a 13h flight, let alone 19h.

We'll think more in the morning + look at alternatives like a road trip through national parks.
