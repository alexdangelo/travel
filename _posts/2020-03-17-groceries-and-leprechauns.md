It was 5 minutes before the grocery store opened at 7am and there was already a gathering of 20-30 people waiting outside. People were cordial as the doors opened but I had a mixed sense of urgency. This was the second grocery store I'd been to this morning, and the three I went to yesterday morning were all out of most of what I needed.

The toilet paper aisle was full of toilet paper! Grabbed two packs because we only have a few rolls left and it's unknown how much will be at future Airbnbs (like our previous Airbnb which came with 1 roll only). Stocked up on nonperishables: tuna, beans, beef jerky, as well as things that freeze and travel well (like bread and cheese).

While we were sleeping the leprechauns came! They left little green rectangular mint chocolates (Andes) in unexpected places all over the house. In past years they also left little green four-leaf clover stickers all over our house but the ones in Florida must do things differently. 

The kids were initially oblivious, maybe because they're used to having little colored rectangles strew about the house, but once they realized it, they looked all over the house, and put them in a common spot to share the findings (their idea, amazing!)

Parent and Big Kid went for a walk to look for lizards (so many here). Little Kid and I stayed and had popsicles on the front porch. But beyond that, it was a day of staying at home and kids watching shows, and attempts at starting to do homeschooling met with resistance.

Little Kid is very selective about food. We bought hot dogs and ketchup for him, but he didn't want it because it didn't have a bun. So Parent eased him into it.

"Would you like beans?"

"No"

"Would you like beans with ketchup"

"Yes!"

"We don't have hot dog buns. Do you want bread?"

"No!"

"Would you like hot dog bread that happens to be rectangular?"

"Yes!"

"Would you like a sausage?" \[not calling it a hot dog\]

"Yes!"
