Big Kid and I exited the Tiki Room to find Parent at the exit with a giant grin on her face while holding a tray with four heaping cones of pineapple Dole Whip (it's like soft serve sorbet). A perk of being a parent with younger kids is they often don't finish their food, so we helped them finish theirs off.

98% complete is the best possible outcome for a ride.

Big Kid and I were on Splash Mountain when it broke. We were essentially done with the ride and waiting several logs back from the unloading area. BUT it worked out for the best! 

We were escorted out through the backstage area ("no photos please, keep the magic") where we saw the bay where logs go to be taken out of service and a workshop with several log-cars sitting out waiting to be repaired. It looks like the backside of a warehouse or a mechanic shop at a dam, but since it's rare to see at Disney, it's way more exciting. 

The BEST part is that despite virtually completing the ride, we didn't complete it, and were given fast passes to go on nearly any ride. It was the end of the day so we can use them tomorrow at ANOTHER park (EPCOT for us). This is great -- there's a ride there I couldn't get reserved before (Test Track) and now we'll get on.

We had fast passes for the Haunted Mansion but it turned out to be closed all day. BUT it worked out for the best -- the fast passes turned into passes that could be used for just about ANY ride!

Little Kid had a much better experience at Magic Kingdom. Lots of rides that were perfect for him. He liked rides that were outside, like rockets that spun in a circle (twice! "super duper good" "200"), teacups, the treehouse (twice!), the Jungle Cruise, and a little rollercoaster (which he only liked a little). He wouldn't go onto rides that went into a building, and we also filtered out rides that we knew he wouldn't like. 

He was a little unsure about the Barnstormer (a little airplane-themed roller coaster) because he was concerned that since it's a rollercoaster it would go upside down, but I assured him it didn't. I think he had mixed feelings about it afterwards. Big Kid LOVED it. But the ride was so incredibly short, which is a good thing for little kids because they may not like it.

We brought a Kindle so he could play games, and we used in in the afternoon. Parent and Big Kid went on a ride, while Little Kid and I sat in the shade and he showed me how to play some games. He really perked up, he really needed that time to himself.
