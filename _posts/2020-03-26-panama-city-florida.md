We're stuck out in the bayou. The propeller won't budge. Reversing it only makes it worse. Guess we'll have to paddle back. We were only out about 200 feet, but trying to paddle a small pedal-powered boat is cumbersome and slow. Back at the dock we lifted the boat out of the water, untangled the rope that had got caught, and right back in the water we went.

We're in Panama City, Florida for a short stay on a boat docked in the harbor.

[Hurricane Michael](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Michael) came through about 1.5 years ago. It was technically really, really big (as in top-4 hurricanes in Florida) and the region is still recovering.

There are so many beautiful brand-new up-on-stilts houses along the beach (literally and unfortunately right on the beach).

But in between are many homes and businesses with missing roofs, missing walls, and decaying in place. Many of the very thin and tall pine trees in the nearby forests are broken in half right about 15' high, the rest of the trunk falling over to make a triangle.

Even along the bayou where we're staying, there are a couple mangled docks and half-submerged boats on the shore (and also plenty of pristine boats in the harbor too).
