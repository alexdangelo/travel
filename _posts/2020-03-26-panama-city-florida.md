We're stuck out in the bayou. The propeller won't budge. Reversing it only makes it worse. Guess we'll have to paddle back. We were only out about 200 feet, but trying to paddle a small pedal-powered boat is cumbersome and slow. Back at the dock we lifted the boat out of the water, untangled the rope that had got caught, and right back in the water we went.

We're in Panama City, Florida. We're staying on a boat docked in the harbor of a bayou which connects to the Gulf of Mexico. It has two bedrooms. One about 10'x10', pretty good size, and the other is much smaller but had two small beds. It's like being in a rustic RV, everything is made out of wood but is also well-used and in different states of disrepair. But I think what's you'd expected from being on a boat.
