Went one day to the [Palo Duro Canyon State Park](https://tpwd.texas.gov/state-parks/palo-duro-canyon) in Texas. Second largest canyon system after the Grand Canyon. All plains around, you'd never guess it was there until it's there. We nearly had the park to ourselves. 

The morning started so cold that icicles lined the bottom of the car. By the time we got down into the canyon, it warmed up by tens of degrees.

The canyon is all red craggy walls of sandstone, eroded into both smooth and rough alien shapes. Some walls looked like [dobos cake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobos_torte) -- layer after layer of brown sandstone and then white jasper (we think).
