We've spent the last week+ packing up the house and moving it into the garage, leaving the furniture and basics (dishes, towels, etc) behind. The house is being rented fully furnished.

We wrote wills, power of attorney for finance, and other legal documents in case things happen and/or we need help while traveling and people back at home to handle it on our behalf. 

The recent coronavirus news might make things more interesting. Originally we planned on going through Japan and South Korea but cancelled those and swapping in South America. The first few weeks of the trip are in Orlando, including Disney World. Disney parks in Asia have closed. Who knows if Disney World will stay open while we're here.
