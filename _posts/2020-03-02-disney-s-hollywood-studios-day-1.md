Loud noises. Dark then bright. Environmental lighting. A shaking room. And flying straight down a snowy canyon and later being attacked.

So it's totally reasonable that Little Kid didn't like going on Star Tours, his first ride of the day. He's afraid of having scary dreams.

And thus concluded Little Kid's desire to go on any rides or shows or anything for the rest of the day.

But he did have a lot of fun playing on the stucco snow and snowman by the Muppet theater, and had a lot of fun playing games on my phone, both by himself and with me.

So Little Kid didn't want to go on rides. But we did. But we can't leave Little Kid by himself. This setup is common, so Disney offers a rider swap. Parent goes with Big Kid, then when they come out, I get to go in with Big Kid via the Fast Pass line. So there's a little bit of waiting but significantly less and then both Parent and I can eventually go on all the same rides.

I was really hoping to avoid long lines by going during the week, following the crowd predictions for best days, and going at the edge of Spring Break season. 

Nope.

But we did mange to get on some rides. Big Kid LOVED Star Tours and went 3 times (the line was surprisingly short). They almost went on the Tower of Terror but bailed at the last minute ("I'll go when I'm older"). They made a good call. I went back to ride and even I was a little scared in anticipation of the drops (and I've been on it many times before!)

Little Kid did get one more ride in at the end of the day after all and it was his favorite: the free gondolas between Disney parks and hotels.

Other Disney notes:

Star Wars Land is open and the fancy "Rise of the Resistance" ride books quickly. A cast member tells me you have to be at the park gate 30-45 minutes before it opens, then be one of the first to get your pass scanned, then immediately go onto your phone to enter a lottery to get a space on the ride. And it completely books up within the first minute of the park being opened, in this case 8am.

And here I was so excited that we made it into the park by 8:30am, a minor miracle in itself.

Tomorrow: Magic Kingdom. I think Little Kid will like this park a lot more.
