The plan: drive from Panama City, Florida to Mobile, Alabama.

Challenges in planning the route to get home are things like this:

> _"Florida will set up road checkpoints along the Panhandle border to direct motorists who have been to Louisiana to quarantine"_

and

> _"The governor also ordered vacation rentals to shut down for the next two weeks to discourage visitors arriving from hot spots such as New York and New Orleans."_

And as we drove out of Florida and into Alabama, sure enough, there were LOTS of police cars, lights flashing, directing non-commercial traffic coming in to Florida for screening. 

Although this didn't affect us, there's concern we will run into similar situations as we enter other states.

We took the scenic route to get to Alabama. Starting in Panama City, FL, we drove over to and through Panama City Beach, FL, which is the city with all the skyscrapers lining the coast, reminiscent of a slightly smaller, more subdued version of the Las Vegas strip.

The houses and mansions are amazing. Beautiful and striking architecture, immaculate. All blindingly pure white or candy-colored pastels. And they keep going for miles and miles. Speed limit is only 25 MPH but in this case I'm glad it slow so we can take it in.

The beaches are all white with turquoise water. It's just like what you see out of a movie. And every single beach is closed. And every state park is closed. And even National Seashore parks are closed. (Even Mexico Beach virtually closed the day after we were there*).

Stopped to get lunch. Take-out only of course, can't sit at the restaurant. Didn't want to sit in the car and eat -- noodles and pot stickers in sauce + kids are a bad idea, plus the car is blazing hot and there's no shade in the parking lot. So we sat on a bench in front of the "temporarily closed" Mexican place a few doors down in the shade of the building overhang. Afterwards rinsed sticky little hands from a water jug I filled at the spigot at the dock earlier in the morning.
