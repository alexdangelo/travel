Lazy day. Laundry. Huge resistance to doing math or anything remotely related to learning. Writing. Parent and Big Kid took the pedal boat out to the bayou, Big Kid knew how to do everything (or tried to insist on doing everything). 

More trip planning. Tentative route now avoids Louisiana and parts of Texas, instead going through Memphis, TN; Oklahoma City; and Amarillo, TX.

In the evening the kids played on the front and top of the boat, frequently climbing up the ladder to get to the on-deck captain's chair, or going back down and briskly walking along the side of the boat to get to the front. And you know what, the walkway on the boat that goes to the front is around 12" inches wide and there's a lot of water on one side, and the wall of the cabin on the other side, so maybe let's not keep going back and forth. Success on the boat is no one falling in the water (and no one did). I truly am a parent.

We went for a BEAUTIFUL walk along the waterfront tonight. It was so warm with a light breeze. There was a Mexican style crescent moon laying down like a boat. You could almost see all the stars in Orion. It felt like we were walking on the Malecon in Puerto Vallarta, but without any businesses and very few people! Far away you could see the big hotels lit up in Panama City Beach. Little Kid had fun running ahead and Big Kid was amazed at how shallow and clear the water was below.
