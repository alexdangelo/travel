Picked up groceries at Wal-Mart for a week in Amarillo, Texas. 

There were exactly two cartons of eggs left: one with each egg completely smashed, and another with only one egg broken but fancy and I'm sure expensive. I bought it anyway, better to have some eggs than none. 

Back at home we discovered a second broken egg, sigh.
