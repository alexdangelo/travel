Like a tropical wasteland in the best way possible. A mix of oak trees, palmetto trees (all palm frond, no trunk), white sand, and brush.

Went for a short hike at the [Allen David Broussard Catfish Creek Preserve State Park](https://www.floridastateparks.org/parks-and-trails/allen-david-broussard-catfish-creek-preserve-state-park). Parent and Big Kid then went off separately because Little Kid was tired. They came back with lots of sand in their shoes, easily 1/3 cup in each of Big Kid's shoes.
