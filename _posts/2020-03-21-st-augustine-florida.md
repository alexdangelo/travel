[St. Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Augustine%2C_Florida) is a colonial town in Florida and looks like something out of Pirates of the Caribbean, but real. Not many people around, most businesses closed. Except for the ice cream shops. There must have been one every 200 feet. 

Normally this must be a super crowded place, there's an enormous parking garage not far from here. We got easy parking right at the fort ([Castillo de San Marcos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castillo_de_San_Marcos)) and the city made it free so people wouldn't touch the parking meters (to reduce risk of spreading COVID-19).
