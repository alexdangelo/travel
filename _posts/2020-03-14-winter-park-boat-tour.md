New Zealand is effectively not allowing people to enter, so that decides the trip for us. We're not going to push for Australia either at this point. Best bet is to do a road trip.

Planning for the "World trip around America", booked the first couple of places in Florida: Jacksonville, Panama City.

Today's activity: [Winter Park Scenic Boat Tour.](https://scenicboattours.com/) Went through canals between lakes, with multimillion dollar mansions lining the banks.
