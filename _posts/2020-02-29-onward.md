We're going on a big trip!  
  
We'll be traveling for the next five months around the Southern Pacific Rim (or close enough).  
  
Rough plan, subject to change

Itinerary: Seattle to Orlando, Florida to Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile to New Zealand to Australia and Tasmania to Hawaii to Seattle between Feb 29 and Aug 8.  
  
So why go now? We've been talking about doing this for some time, planning in earnest about a year and a half ago. The timing was perfect. The kids are old enough and we wanted to explore and spend more time with them while they're still young. I was also ready to leave PayScale as a software engineering manager after nearly 9 years (I need to recharge).
