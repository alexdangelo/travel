Let's try this again: 

We're taking a road trip! To our home in the Pacific Northwest!

We are currently in Orlando, FL which is conveniently just about the farthest distance away from home in the continental US (just over 3000 miles).

That's LOT of driving time in the car, especially for the kids. Unknown how long it will take so the rental car is due back home on June 20, about 90 days from now, because it was cheaper to book full months at a time instead of partial months. (We'll keep using a large sedan because I got an amazing deal and a minivan is SUPER expensive).

We'll keep being flexible especially as the world changes due to coronavirus / COVID-19. So we may get back even earlier than June 20, or maybe not. (Original plan was early Aug). We're trying to minimize health risks plus everything is closed. Even at national parks, the gates and trails are open but visitor centers, etc are closed. We've got nonperishables with us so we're ok if we get stuck for a while in any location.
