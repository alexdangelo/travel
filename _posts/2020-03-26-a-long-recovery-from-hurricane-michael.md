Panama City, Florida and the surrounding region is still recovering from \[Hurricane Michael\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Michael](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Michael "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Michael")) came through in Oct 2018 (about 1.5 years ago). It was technically really, really big (as in top-4 hurricanes in Florida) and the region is still recovering.

There are so many beautiful brand-new up-on-stilts houses along the beach (literally and unfortunately right on the beach).

But in between are many homes and businesses with missing roofs, missing walls, and decaying in place. Many of the very thin and tall pine trees in the nearby forests are broken in half right about 15' high, the rest of the trunk falling over to make a triangle.

Even along the bayou where we're staying, there are a couple mangled docks and half-submerged boats on the shore (and also plenty of pristine boats in the harbor too).
