$1.19/gal for gas.

$1.19/gal FOR GAS!

I filled the car for $1.19/gal for gas! I put in as much as the tank could possibly hold. Wow!

Twenty minutes later: $0.98/gal for gas.

\[Update 4/2: I filled up on $0.99/gal gas!\]

We're driving from Mobile, Alabama to Amarillo, Texas, but it's a 14 hour drive so we're breaking it up over a few days. The path takes us across Mississippi, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. We're trying to get home quicker while avoiding flying, even if that means driving a long time and many quick overnight stays along the way.
