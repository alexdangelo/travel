Big Kid is an expert at provoking Little Kid. Little Kid has his share of picking fights too. There is also plenty of whining about so many things. And often them testing limits.

This permeates every day and every activity.

It's all very tiring. And it's amplified by being on this trip. And it's only been a week since the trip started. 

For example, every time we drive someplace, within 5-10 minutes the peace devolves into hitting/pinching/kicking and then crying. They play games where there is some form of bonking or hitting each other (because they are mutually having fun) and it inevitably turns into someone getting hurt. 

In their defense, they're acting their age, they're spending a lot of time together, they're tired or hungry, and need more playground time, friend time, alone time.

Being full of food makes everyone happier. It's such a challenge to get them to eat enough. Big Kid is easier than before. Little Kid is far more selective, and easily distracted, and he's small so his tummy doesn't hold that much food anyway. There are guaranteed items that he almost always likes (such as hot dogs, fries, ketchup) but not the healthiest or balanced. 

\[Update 3/15: A week later, it's still a problem, maybe a little bit better. We're working with the kids to use more words. Additional things that will help include what's listed above, finding ways to engage them more, such as Parent making a scavenger hunt when we went to a botanical garden, and each kid having more space.\]
