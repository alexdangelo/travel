We learned first-hand that paddling upstream is harder than downstream.

(All the canoeing experience I've had has been in lakes where there mostly wasn't a current, aside from a windy day crossing by the entrance to the Montlake Cut in Seattle.)

The four of us went canoeing down the Wekiwa River, which is shallow and crystal clear, with dense, lush tropical plans lining the sides. Or in some cases, a very tall palm tree growing out over the water, low enough to touch the top from the canoe. It's surprising how much work it takes to paddle back. And we didn't tip over! (there was a non-zero chance of that happening with two kids sitting in the middle).

We learned what no-see-ums are today. The hard way.

Played in the natural springs at [Wekiwa Springs State Park](https://www.floridastateparks.org/parks-and-trails/wekiwa-springs-state-park). It's always 72 degrees. We didn't come prepared for swimming so Little Kid stripped down to his underwear, and Big Kid went in with his shorts on. I noticed but ignored tiny bugs flying around. Only when taking a shower did we see the results: parts of Big Kid's back, Little Kid's shoulder, and my hand covered with little red spots. Fortunately it's not dangerous just annoying

\[Update Mar 17: the next morning the spots had all disappeared. Phew!\]

On the drive over, the kids worked through an activity book playing bingo (but with a list of things to look for when driving) and hangman (Little Kid knows how to spell one word (exit) and has Big Kid guessing for a while). The pleasant chatter of kids getting along is the best soundtrack.

Earlier: this morning went out to grocery stores at 6:30am (mostly because I woke up early enough). Both were out of toilet paper. I had been to one the night before, what was on the shelves (or what wasn't on the shelves) hadn't really changed. The only exception was a lot of store-brand pasta appearing where there was none.
