Early mornings, late nights, and going all day is really catching up with us, plus not sleeping great at night. We ignored our alarms to wake up in time for rope drop and slept in.

  
I know we're doing this to ourselves, we can stop at any time. But there is still today and the next two days of paid Disney parks before the passes expire. New plan: enjoy Magic Kingdom today, take it easy tomorrow and have a short day at Epcot, then see how we do on Thurs at the Magic Kingdom for our last day.
