We'll be on a road trip across the South and in hot weather. We need some things but they need to be inexpensive if/when we need to ditch them as the trip goes by. 

We found the thrift store for you. Need Mickey Mouse ears? Baseball hats? Sunglasses (4 pairs of sunglasses for $0.89)? Disney merchandise? They get it from Disney's lost-and-found when things go unclaimed. 

Little Kid got a long-sleeve shirt for $1 (he hates sunscreen so it's long sleeves for him). The kids need more toys (never thought I'd say that), so we picked up a brand-new building blocks, a toy car, even a rare-to-me white Lego shark. Books for the kids to read, especially at bedtime too. Knowing that we'll be driving means its easier to take these items with us.

Later, went to the grocery store to get supplies. It was all out of staples, like toilet paper, eggs, milk, bread, etc.
