Spent the afternoon at the [Harry P. Leu Botanical Gardens](https://www.leugardens.org/). We got lucky, it happened to be a free day. A very lush garden with lots of variety. So many types of palm trees in the tropics area: tall, fat, large, skinny, all sorts of shapes. Also very hot out which wore us down.
