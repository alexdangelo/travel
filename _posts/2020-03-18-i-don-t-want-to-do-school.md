"I don't want to do school!". Both Big Kid and Little Kid are resistant. But we set a time and eventually got them to sit down. I got Big Kid engaged by teasing the problem of "how do we draw a curve (parabola) with math?" and then scaled it back to "how do we use math to draw a line?" We learned about variables, truth tables, and how constants shift a line around. 

We used an empty cereal box as paper since we don't have much with us at the moment (I'm sure it's easy to get a ream at the office supply store). Parent's with Little Kid making objects out of chop sticks and rubber bands and they're outside exploring.
