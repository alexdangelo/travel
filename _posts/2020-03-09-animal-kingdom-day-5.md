It's getting harder to get up early in the morning to make it to the park when it opens. The daylight saving time change ("spring forward") makes it even harder because it still feels like waking up 1 hour earlier than "regular" waking up early.

Little Kid collected merit badges from rangers all over Animal Kingdom. A great activity for kids, especially with long lines for rides. He was really into it, insisting we find the ranger even when none were around, and with a little persistence we'd find them. 

Parent took Little Kid to the giant playground and sandbox within the park. His eye lit up and he made two friends immediately. He went down a three-story plastic twisty slide too. The playground was truly his favorite part of the day.

Waiting in line for the Lion King show, Little Kid melted down while his ice cream melted down. He wanted a cone, but it turns out he really wanted a popsicle. And I bet he was tired and overstimulated too. But this was on top of Parent getting treats while I held a place in line (remember, it's really busy). She had to carry two PLATES with a single ice cream scoop melting and threatening to slide off while navigating the crowds between the shop to the line where we were. Why not bowls or cones? Who knows.

Went on the safari, the flight ride, Everest, Dinosaur, and others. Overall had a good time, it's a fun park.

We finally did what I had avoided at all Disney parks: wait in line for over an hour. Actually, we waited nearly two hours to go on the safari ride in a massive jeep through the wildlife preserve. Kids did great in line: Big Kid played games, Little Kid watched or gave pointers. 

We had lunch before waiting in line which helped a lot. (Lunch was at the Harambe market, and we sat next to the fence watching the steam train go right by every so often).

Parent observed that Big Kid got to go on rides in increasing impressiveness across the parks: Star Tours -> Soarin' -> Avatar Flight of Passage. These are rides that simulate flying through some environment, each improving upon the previous one. Just luck in the order visited.
