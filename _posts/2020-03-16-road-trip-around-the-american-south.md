New plan: We're going on a road trip around the American South! 

We'll visit national and state parks and do other outdoor activities. Tentatively it's for the next 4 months but we'll keep reevaluating the destinations and duration as things change. We're looking into renting a minivan (in particular to give the kids more personal space) and will stay at Airbnbs along the way. That should let us explore and take advantage of the time we have while keeping us separate from crowds aside from the grocery store.

The original plan of traveling around the Southern Pacific Rim is "postponed" until the next time it makes sense to quit work and pull kids of out school, whenever that may be. And to save up for it too.

We're in Orlando, FL for the rest of the week. Our Airbnb host asked if we wanted to extend because everyone cancelled their reservations for the rest of the month, and even his housecleaners quit. But time to move on.

Coming up: Jacksonville, FL (it's near the coast) for a few days, then head west to Panama City, FL (on the coast of the panhandle) for a few more days.
