"There are so many lizards here!" Big Kid is currently running all over the yard, then stopping and stalking lizards and trying to catching them. Sunset, warm breeze, clear sky.

## [Blue Spring State Park](https://www.floridastateparks.org/parks-and-trails/blue-spring-state-park)

Manatees come to the spring _Big Kid leave Little Kid alone_ in the wintertime but _Little Kid stop pinching Big Kid_ have already left for the season. We can see lots of fish _Big Kid stop touching Little Kid_ through the crystal-clear water, including catfish and [gar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gar) (a very long fish with a long pointy snout). _Little Kid stop attacking Big Kid!_

We even saw a long black snake and a skink (a type of lizard) _I don't care who started it, it's who stopped it_. A long elevated boardwalk snaked through the lush tropical jungle and overlooking the natural _Big Kid stop provoking Little Kid!_ spring bubbling up from the rocks. In summer, after Manatee season, people go swimming and tubing in the 72F water. On the way back, saw the proverbial turtle (well, actually a tortoise) crossing the road _Little Kid stop trying to stab Big Kid with the pen!_
