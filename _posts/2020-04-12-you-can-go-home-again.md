We're back!

Came home to a beautiful spring day, blue skies, perfect weather. The very first thing the kids did after getting home, not even going inside the house, was to bike and scooter, then play in their secret fort in front of the house.

Overall it was a great trip. It wasn't the trip we had planned but it achieved everything I wanted: to see new places, time with family, and time to relax separately and together.
