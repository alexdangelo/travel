We're in the middle of loading up our car to leave the Airbnb. It's kind of windy outside, no rain. It's still coming. I want to feel the wind pick up a bit before taking shelter in the bathroom.

Ten minutes later, the warning is cancelled. The heavy downpour of rain comes as we drive out of town. Crisis averted!
