The [Canaveral National Seashore](https://www.nps.gov/cana/index.htm) is free today. Unexpected!

Just north of where the space shuttle and SpaceX rockets are launched at Kennedy Space Center. We can even see the NASA [Vehicle Assembly Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_Assembly_Building) towering over the jungle.

Very warm water, nice blue color. Sticky fine sand.

When we got back home, found out the Canaveral National Seashore is closing for an undetermined amount of time to reduce people gathering on the beach to reduce the spread of COVID-19 .

Also found out that all National parks are now free. Unsure for how long. [All visitor centers, etc are closed](https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/news/public-health-update.htm) but gates and trails are still open.
