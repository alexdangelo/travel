Little Kid was doing everything he could to prevent us from walking down the aisle to our seats on the airplane.

Literally standing in the aisle and pushing the three of us back towards the front of the airplane. And after about 10 rows of nudging him forward, I couldn't get him to budge anymore, especially since I was carrying two heavy carryons + a backpack.

Little Kid was hungry and wanted food immediately. And had been up since early in the morning and was tired. The irony is that when we eventually got him to our seats, he had a few cheese bites, then rejected the actual food we got him because he wasn't hungry.

We're only on day 1 of the trip and already have surprises:

We made it to Orlando!

Our stroller made it to Dallas!

The irony was the connecting flight was the same plane; it could have just stayed on.

We made it to our Airbnb!

By Taxi!

Because the rental car place was out of cars.

Which we discovered at midnight.

After waiting for a half-hour at baggage for our stroller to not show up (remember, it's in Dallas).

After the flight was delayed by a half hour.

Tomorrow I get to take another taxi back to the airport to pick up the rental car and drive back.

At least the rental car company will reimburse me for the taxis.

And the airline will deliver the stroller to our place.

Good thing day 2 is all about being lazy and getting settled in.

I watched a movie on the plane, if you count is as watching the first 25 seconds and only seeing the names of the companies that produced it. Instead, Little Kid and I played Super Mario World, taking turns between levels. It's still really fun!

\---

Small joys: the second flight was virtually completely full, but I had an open seat next to me. A rare treat.

\---

We have free passes to the airport lounge (translation: free lunch). The departure gate is virtually the farthest away from the lounge. Too bad.
