It wasn't until nearly 8pm that Little Kid wanted to go on rides, with the exception of the Swiss Family Robinson Treehouse.

We got in not too long after opening, lines were still short. Parent and Big Kid went straight to the Haunted Mansion. Little Kid and I hopped on the horse-drawn streetcar that goes from the main plaza down to the castle. Felt luxurious to do that, normally wouldn't because of wanting to get on rides, but it was available and we had the time. Little Kid, however, didn't want to go on any rides after that, so we walked around. 

He changed his mind in the evening. We took him on Peter Pan and he loved it, and wanted to go on Small World next. So we did.

The last day of the Disney World portion of the trip. We're both excited to move on and sad because it's fun despite the lines and heat.
